STACK AND HEAP METHOD - MEMORY

stack - primitve
    -you get a copy of your data when you ask for it
    -stacked on top of one another 

heap - non.primitive
    -you get a refrence instead
    -chnaeges will take place in orginal data
    
    let user = {
        email: "one@gmail.com",
        upi: "buser one upi"
    };

    let user2 = user;

    user2.upi = "user two upi";


    console.log(user.upi);
    console.log(user2.upi);

        //things inside a class can be accesed via the dotnotaition

    changing the values in the first shit also changed the value here,
    as the value will be changed in both the places the refrence point is the same
