STACK AND HEAP METHOD - MEMORY

stack - primitve
    -you get a copy of your data when you ask for it
    -stacked on top of one another 

heap - non.primitive
    -you get a refrence instead
    -chnaeges will take place in orginal data
    
    let user = {
        email: "one@gmail.com",
        upi: "buser one upi"
    };

    let user2 = user;

    user2.upi = "user two upi";


    console.log(user.upi);
    console.log(user2.upi);

        //things inside a class can be accesed via the dotnotaition

    changing the values in the first shit also changed the value here,
    as the value will be changed in both the places the refrence point is the same


-thats why we use a constructor and object factories to create the copies of the object


OBJECTS


-Singleton,
     object is made by constructors not by object literals

-OBJECT LITERALS



 SCOPES

VALUE 

-{ } , with function, if else....
-every curly bases marks the begining of a new scope which has its own Scope
-NESTED SCOPES 

VAR PROBLIMS
    -it is function scoped i.e if it is declared inside a block inside a function it wont be spcific to that block it will be could be accesed in the whole function
        -BLOK.SCOPE == {} , start of {} marks the start of the new block
            - it gives us the option of limiting visibility
    -if we declare a variable in line 20, it will be accessable in line 10 as well... which will create huge problims in  a large code base
